QUESTION-2

So here we are creating a smart contract name Voting, to manage a decentralised voting system.
We are defining state variables like(admin, candidateID, voterID) to store the address of the owner and to provide unique id to candidates and voters. Then struct Candidate and Voter are defined. Then using constructor admin is declared. Then modifiers are defined to check if the input id for getvotes and vote functions are valid or not and also if only admin is adding voters and candidates or not. Then mapping is declared to map each candidate and voter with itâ€™s unique id.
Now, functions are declared. In addCandidate function a candidate is added to the mapping with 0 votes using his name. In registerVoter function firstly it is checked if the voter is already registered, if not then using its address it is added to the Voters map. In vote function firstly it is checked if the person is registered, and further it is checked if h/she has already voted, if not then his/her vote is added to the no. of votes of the candidate he/she voted for using the candidateID. The getVoteCount function returns the no. of votes of the candidate whose ID has been given as argument. The getWinner function returns the name of candidate who won the election by comparing votes of each candidate.
How to run the tests?
The VotingTest smart contract is designed to test the functionalities of the Voting contract, ensuring robustness and correctness. It includes tests for adding candidates, registering voters, allowing voters to cast votes, and verifying results such as candidate vote counts and determining the winner. Setup initializes instances of Voting and defines admin and non-admin addresses. Test functions cover scenarios like successful candidate addition and voter registration, handling invalid votes, preventing duplicate registrations, and ensuring non-admin users cannot perform administrative actions. Assertions confirm expected outcomes, such as correct candidate names and vote counts. These tests aim to validate core contract functionalities and edge cases, providing confidence in the Voting contract's behavior under various conditions.
